h1. Some examples on how to use buildr.apache.org

I often struggled a while, till I got all the small details right for a certain problem. Therefore I started this project.

It contains various subdirectories, which contain each a small, self contained buildfile which exercises a specific problem.

* p2site
** Create an eclipse p2site with 2 features (uses buildr4osgi)
* wikitext_to_pdf
** Transforms this readme.textile to a pdf
** uses wikitext_to_xslfo
** uses Antwrap
** tests whether generated zip file really contains the desired PDF file
* java_and_scala
** handling a project which contains java and scala files and where java files depend on scala
